# Conquer(CQ)

## Introduction

The scope of the project is to promote walking as part of commuting. In a fast-paced society like Singapore, people would try to complete their activities quickly which includes their daily commute. Hence, walking will be the least favourite for commuting. In order to encourage commuters in Singapore to lead a healthier lifestyle, CQ provides users with a curated walking experience for their First Mile and Last Mile (FMLM) portions of their journey. The mobile navigation application which, is available in IOS and Android platform, guides users through the possible routes to their destination and users will be able to perform a step-by-step navigation. When users are at the train station, they are allowed to conquer it to gain more points. It allows users to provide feedback on each route they take in terms of safety, speed and enjoyment. Upon arriving at the train station, the user is able to conquer the train station in exchange of some points.
